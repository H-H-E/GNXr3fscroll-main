\_\_\_\_\_\_"Wacced Out Murals"\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  
\[Intro: Deyra Barrera\]  
Siento aquí tu presencia  
La noche de anoche  
Y nos ponemos a llorar

\[Verse 1\]  
Yesterday, somebody whacked out my mural  
That energy'll make you niggas move to Europe  
But it's regular for me, yeah, that's for sure  
The love and hate is definite without a cure  
All this talk is bitch-made, that's on my Lord  
I'll kill 'em all before I let 'em kill my joy  
I done been through it all, what you endure?  
It used to be fuck that nigga, but now it's plural  
Fuck everybody, that's on my body  
My blick first, then God got me  
I watch 'em pander with them back-handed compliments  
Put they head on a Cuban link as a monument  
I paid homage and I always mind my business  
I made the—  
I never lost who I am for a rap image  
It's motivation if you wonder how I did it

\[Chorus\]  
Yeah, nigga, go and up your rank  
Know you a god even when they say you ain't  
Yeah, nigga, keep your feelings out the way  
Never let no one put smut up on your name  
Yeah, nigga, keep your head down and work like I do  
But understand everybody ain't gon' like you  
Yeah, nigga, if they say it's love, you've been lied to  
A couple rules of engagements, I'ma guide you

\[Post-Chorus: Deyra Barrera\]  
Que refleja en tu mirada  
La noche, tú y yo

\[Verse 2\]  
Ridin' in my GNX with Anita Baker in the tape deck, it's gon' be a sweet love  
Fuck apologies, I wanna see y'all geeked up  
Don't acknowledge me, then maybe we can say it's fair  
Take it to the internet and I'ma take it there  
Miss my uncle Lil' Mane, he said that he would kill me if I didn't make it  
Now I'm possessed by a spirit and they can't take it  
Used to bump Tha Carter III, I held my Rollie chain proud  
Irony, I think my hard work let Lil Wayne down  
Whatever, though, call me crazy, everybody questionable  
Turn me to an eskimo, I drew the line and decimals  
Snoop posted "Taylor Made," I prayed it was the edibles  
I couldn't believe it, it was only right for me to let it go  
Won the Super Bowl and Nas the only one congratulate me  
All these niggas agitated, I'm just glad they showin' they faces  
Quite frankly, plenty artists, but they outdated  
Old-ass flows, tryna convince me that you they favorite  
This is not for lyricists, I swear it's not the sentiments  
Fuck a double entendre, I want y'all to feel this shit  
Old soul, bitch, I probably built them pyramids  
Ducking strays when I rap battled in the Nickersons  
Where you from? Not where I'm from, we all indigenous  
Against all odds, I squabbled up for them dividends  
Against all odds, I showed up as a gentleman  
I done lost plenty friends, sixteen to be specific  
Put that on my kids' children, we gon' see the future first  
They like, "Dot big trippin," I just want what I deserve  
What bridge they done burnt? All of them, it's over with  
I'm doin' what COVID did, they'll never get over it

\[Chorus\]  
Yeah, nigga, go and up your rank  
Know you a god even when they say you ain't  
Yeah, nigga, keep your feelings out the way  
Never let no one put smut up on your name  
Yeah, nigga, keep your head down and work like I do  
But understand everybody ain't gon' like you  
Yeah, nigga, if they say it's love, you've been lied to  
A couple rules of engagements, here to guide you

\[Verse 3\]  
Niggas from my city couldn't entertain old boy  
Promisin' bank transactions and even bitcoin  
I never peaced it up, that shit don't sit well with me  
Before I take a truce, I'll take 'em to Hell with me  
If that money got in the hands of a crash dummy  
Could jeopardize my family and burden the ones who love me  
Niggas mad 'cause I decided not to pretend  
Y'all stay politically correct, I'ma do what I did  
Ain't no sympathy here, this shit's hilarious  
It's a lot of opinions, but no power to carry it  
2025, they still movin' on some scary shit  
Tell 'em quit they job and pay the real niggas they severance  
Don't insult my intelligence, I'm not just for the television  
Teleport to Bullets Road and dig up all my relatives  
Okay, nigga, let's settle it, these niggas been fake loyal  
Since y'all pandering to choose a side, let me do it for you  
Okay, fuck your hip-hop, I watched the party just die  
Niggas cackling about— while all of y'all is on trial  
Niggas thought that I was antisocial when I stayed inside of my house  
You better off to have one woman, everything tricky right now  
You niggas live in denial  
Ayy, fuck anybody empathetic to the other side, I vow  
A bitch nigga love bitch niggas, they exist with 'em in style  
Exterminate 'em right now  
Make Katt Williams and them proud, the truth 'bout to get loud  
No juice inside of my cup, I sober up and knock 'em all off  
Don't let no white comedian talk about no Black woman, that's law  
I know propaganda work for them, and fuck whoever that's close to them  
The niggas that coon, the niggas that bein' groomed, slide on both of them  
You ever ate Cap'n Crunch and proceeded to pour water in it?  
Pulled over by the law, you ridin' dirty, so you can't argue with 'em?  
Then make it to be a star, bare your soul and put your heart up in it?  
Well, I did  
Whacked the murals out, but it ain't no legends if my legend ends

\_\_\_\_\_\_"Squabble Up"\_\_\_\_\_\_

\[Intro: Kendrick Lamar\]  
God knows  
I am reincarnated  
I was stargazin'  
Life goes on, I need all my babies (Gyah, gyah)

\[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar & Debbie Deb\]  
Woke up lookin' for the broccoli  
High-key, keep a horn on me, that Kamasi  
IP, ownership, the blueprint is by me  
Mr. Get Off, I get off and mop feet  
When I hear music, it makes me dance  
You got the music, now is your chance  
A yee nigga couldn't try me in the tri-state  
Buddy pass, bet I get him splashed 'til he hydrated  
Bounce out, know he spook town, eyes dilated  
I got the money and the power both gyratin'

\[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar\]  
I feel good, get the fuck out my face  
Look good, but she don't got no taste  
I walk in, walked out with the safe  
Mando, let me know what the play

\[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar\]  
What the fuck?  
I got hits, I got bucks, I got new paper cuts  
I got friends, I got foes, but they all sitting ducks  
Hit his turf and get crackin', double back like a deluxe  
Fifty deep, but it ain't deep enough  
Fuck a plea, there he go, beat him up  
Fallin' from a money tree and it grow throughout the months  
Spit a loogie at the camera, speed off, yeah, it's us

\[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar\]  
I feel good, get the fuck out my face  
Look good, but she don't got no taste  
I walk in, walked out with the safe  
Mando, let me know what the play

\[Post-Chorus: Kendrick Lamar\]  
Squabble up, squabble up  
Squabble up, squabble up  
Squabble up (Mm, mm), squabble up (Mm, mm)  
Squabble up (Mm, mm), squabble up

\[Bridge: Kendrick Lamar\]  
Hol' up (Hol' up)  
Where you from? (Where you from?)  
Bye, bitch (Bye, bitch)  
I'm finna go dumb (Finna go dumb)  
Sideways (Sideways)  
Bunk skunk (Bunk skunk)  
Fever (Fever)  
I'm on one (I'm on one)

\[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar\]  
Thunk, thunk, thunk, thunk, thunk, baby rockin' it  
Quid pro quo, what you want? 'Cause I'm watchin' it  
Work on the floor, let me know if you clockin' it  
Brodie won't go, but I know that he poppin' it  
It was woof tickets on sale 'til I silenced it  
Pipe down, young, these some whole other politics  
Bitch with him and some bitch in him, that's a lot of bitch  
Don't hit him, he got kids with him, my apologies  
Ghetto child, it was Blacky Milds with the Smirnoff  
Yeehaw, we outside, whoadie 'bout to kill him off  
Blaps on blaps, it's a fact, this a brick of raw  
Tell me why the fuck you niggas rap if it's fictional?  
Tell me why the fuck you niggas fed if you criminal?  
"Ayy, Dot, can I get a drop?" I'm like, "Nigga, nah"  
Ace boon coon from the Westside to Senegal  
It's a full moon, let the wolves out, I been a dog (Ah)

\[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar\]  
I feel good, get the fuck out my face  
Look good, but she don't got no taste  
I walk in, walked out with the safe  
Mando, let me know what the play

\[Post-Chorus: Kendrick Lamar\]  
Squabble up, squabble up  
Squabble up, squabble up  
Squabble up (Mm, mm), squabble up (Mm, mm)  
Squabble up (Mm, mm), squabble up

\[Intro\]  
If this world were mine

\[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar\]  
Hey, Roman numeral seven, bae, drop it like it's hot  
If this world was mine, I'd take your dreams and make 'em multiply  
If this world was mine, I'd take your enemies in front of God  
Introduce 'em to that light, hit them strictly with that fire  
Fah-fah, fah-fah-fah, fah-fah, fah  
Hey, Roman numeral seven, bae, drop it like it's hot  
If this world was mine, I'd take your dreams and make 'em multiply  
If this world was mine, I'd take your enemies in front of God  
Introduce 'em to that light, hit them strictly with that fire  
It's a vibe, do your dance, let 'em watch  
She a fan, he a flop, they just wanna kumbaya, nah

\[Chorus: SZA, SZA & Kendrick Lamar\]  
In this world, concrete flowers grow  
Heartache, she only doin' what she know  
Weekends, get it poppin' on the low  
Better days comin' for sure  
If this world were—  
If it was up to me  
I wouldn't give these nobodies no sympathy  
I'd take away the pain, I'd give you everything  
I just wanna see you win, wanna see  
If this world were mine

\[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar & SZA\]  
It go in (When you), out (Ride it), do it real slow (Slide)  
Baby, you a star, strike, pose  
When I'm (When you), with you (With me), everything goes (Slow)  
Come and (Put that), put that (On my), on my (Titi), soul (Soul)  
'Rari (Red), crown (Stack), wrist (Stay), froze (Really)  
Drip (Tell me), pound (If you), on the way home (Love me)

\[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar & SZA\]  
In this world, concrete flowers grow  
Heartache, she only doin' what she know  
Weekends, get it poppin' on the low  
Better days comin' for sure  
If this world were—  
If it was up to me  
I wouldn't give these nobodies no sympathy  
I'd take away the pain, I'd give you everything  
I just wanna see you win, wanna see  
If this world were mine

\[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar & SZA\]  
I can't lie  
I trust you, I love you, I won't waste your time  
I turn it off just so I can turn you on  
I'ma make you say it loud  
I'm not even trippin', I won't stress you out  
I might even settle down for you, I'ma show you I'm a pro  
I'ma take my time and turn it off  
Just so I can turn you on, baby  
Weekends, get it poppin' on the low  
Better days comin' for sure

\[Outro: SZA\]  
I know you're comin' for  
Better days  
If this world were mine

\_\_"Man at the Garden"\_\_\_  
\[Verse 1\]  
Twice emotional stability  
Of sound body and tranquility  
I deserve it all  
Like minds and less enemies  
Stock investments, more entities  
I deserve it all  
VVSs, white diamonds  
GNX with the seat back, reclinin', bitch  
I deserve it all  
Put my homes on the beachfront  
Flyin' private, what you eat for lunch?  
I deserve it all  
The respect and the accolades  
Lampin' on the island, watchin' Cast Away  
I deserve it all  
For every good nigga that passed away  
Sent two-point-five million on an average day  
I deserve it all  
Keep my name by the world leaders  
Keep my crowds loud inside Ibiza  
I deserve it all  
More money, more power, more freedom  
Everything Heaven allowed us, bitch  
I deserve it all

\[Chorus\]  
Hmm, I deserve it all  
Hmm, I deserve it all  
All  
All

\[Verse 2\]  
'Cause my intentions was pure  
Even when you wasn't sure  
Even with every allure  
How much temptation you endured?  
You'd probably look for every cure  
I said I deserve it all  
I'm wakin' up at 6 a.m.  
Six miles a day, conditionin' my wind  
I said I deserve it all  
I'm showin' up as your friend  
Tellin' truths better than your next of kin  
I said I deserve it all  
I never ask for too much credit  
Seekin' validation just for the aesthetics, bitch  
I deserve it all  
I see you as a human first  
Even when you didn't understand your worth  
Bitch, I deserve it all  
It's innate to mind my business  
Writin' words, tryna elevate these children  
That's why I deserve it all  
Pray for those who prayed against me  
Every reason why my ancestors sent me  
Bitch, I deserve it all

\[Chorus\]  
I deserve it all  
I deserve it all  
All  
All

\[Verse 3\]  
Put a smile on my mama  
Good health and good karma  
Yeah, she deserves it all  
One hundred murals out in Compton  
Remember me? I kept my promise  
Yeah, we deserve it all  
A better life for my daughter  
Made my son take it further than his father  
Yeah, he deserves it all  
A close relationship with God  
Whisper to me every time I close my eyes  
He say, "You deserve it all"  
Keep these bitch niggas away from me  
Keep all my blessings faithfully  
Keep my essence contagious, that's okay with me  
I burn this bitch down, don't you play with me or stay with me  
I'm crashin' out right now, no one's safe with me  
I did it with integrity and niggas still try hate on me, just wait and see  
More blood be spillin', it's just paint to me  
Dangerously, nothin' changed with me, still got pain in me  
Flip a coin, want the shameless me or the famous me?  
How annoying, does it angers me to know the lames can speak  
On the origins of the game I breathe? That's insane to me  
It's important, I deserve it all because it's mine  
Tell me why you think you deserve the greatest of all time, motherfucker

\[Outro\]  
I deserve it all  
I deserve it all

\_\_"Hey Now" (featuring Dody6)\_\_\_  
\[Intro: Kendrick Lamar\]  
Damn, baby  
I like it  
Damn  
Hmm

\[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar\]  
Hey now, say now, I'm all about my Yen  
Big face Buddha, get my peace from within  
Send the kites to all my dirties in the pen  
Let the honorary walk for the win, for the win  
You crash out, then you better break the backboard  
I got friends, hopin' that they make the tabloids  
You know the last one figured he was Magneto  
You play God, you gon' get what you ask for  
We got the same twenty-four, what you mad for?  
I put a square on his back like I'm Jack Dorsey  
It's high beams if I make a public appearance  
Go back to hidin' 'cause I'm not too friendly with niggas  
One one thousand, two one thousand, four  
The Black know I just strangled me a goat  
I walked in with a therapeutic flow  
Put a few hundred up, let 'em go, let 'em go

\[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar\]  
Hey now, say now  
Hey now, say now  
Hey now, say now  
Hmm, hey now, say now  
Hey now, say now, I'm all about my Yen  
Big face Buddha, get my peace from within  
Send the kites to all my dirties in the pen  
Let the honorary walk for the win, for the win  
Hey now, say now  
Hey now, say now  
Hey now, say now  
Hey now, say now

\[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar\]  
Hey now, say now, I done slid on they backstreet  
Heavy on the Parmesan, every day tax season  
What the fuck you wearin'? Bro, it's tacky  
Niggas layin' on they death bed tryna match me  
Oh my God, I'm 'bout to do the fool  
They be screamin' out P, but they resume is boof  
Switch both lanes, the engine sound like the zoo  
Need a fee just to breathe, bitch, I can't talk to you  
It's the Ben Frank murderer  
Mister, I ain't heard of ya  
Gulf streams, back to back, flyin' through the turbulence  
Who is he? Free lunch, hmm, Kraft Services  
Throw your ass out this rental if I smell nervousness  
Hey now, say now, let me pop my shit  
Water down my wrist, I'm around my bitch  
It's a green light, don't get out of bounds, I'ma blitz  
It's a bird, it's a plane, no, it's all blue strips  
Nigga, what?

\[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar\]  
Hey now, say now  
Hey now, say now  
Hey now, say now  
Hmm, hey now, say now  
I'm way too important  
I'm way too important  
I'm way too important to ever let you slide on me again

\[Bridge: Kendrick Lamar\]  
Startin' to see spaceships on Rosecrans (Startin' to see spaceships on Rosecrans)  
I seen the aliens hold hands (I seen the aliens hold hands)  
They wanna see me do my dance (They wanna see me do my dance)  
I let 'em watch me do my dance

\[Verse 3: Dody6 & Kendrick Lamar\]  
Who the fuck I feel like? I feel like Joker  
Harley Quinn, I'm in the cut with a blower  
Ayy, shit get spooky, every day in October  
My torpedo even jumped out on smokers, J-Cat  
Ayy, we mean muggin' niggas, Dody too important  
If they talkin' 'bout playin' ball, me and my team gon' get to scorin'  
If they talkin' 'bout playin' ball, they can take it up with Jordan  
It's bald heads and the heckling for all endorsements  
Eenie, meenie, miny, moe, I'm tryna tag a nigga toe  
I'm aggressive on the beat and real life, niggas know  
Ayy, I tatted up my body, it depend, level four  
Ayy, I sharpened up a knife and came home to a blow  
My bitch gon' get to tweakin' like she playin' with her nose  
Lil' brodie 'bout to crash, man, y'all niggas be on go  
I'm a different type of trophy, baby girl, I'm rose gold  
Me and Dot get to slidin', put 'em in a choke hold  
Bitches actin' like some niggas, niggas actin' like some hoes  
Ayy, I jumped out that pan, then I jumped up in a Ghost  
I'm the hush type of nigga, see my face, then he froze  
All that shit he was talkin', found out he not that bold  
Okay, this shit like forty, that's a dub, okay, let's add it up  
Baby ass fat, can you do it? Can you back it up?  
Kickflip a nigga, I got Tech Decks  
And it ain't shit for me to call and get your chin checked  
Tell 'em, "Dody did that"

\_\_"Reincarnated"\_\_\_

\[Intro: Deyra Barrera\]  
Que reflejan tu mirada  
La noche, tú y yo

\[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar\]  
I got this fire burnin' in me from within  
Concentrated thoughts on who I used to be, I'm sheddin' skin  
Every day, a new version of me, a third of me demented, cemented in pain  
Juggling the pros and cons of fame  
I don't know how to make friends, I'm a lonely soul  
I recollect this isolation, I was four years old  
Truth be told, I've been battling my soul  
Tryna navigate the real and fake  
Cynical about the judgement day  
I did past life regression last year and it fucked me up  
Reincarnated on this earth for a hundred plus  
Body after body, lesson after lesson, let's take it back to Michigan in 1947  
My father kicked me out the house 'cause I wouldn't listen to him  
I didn't care about his influence, only loved what I was doing  
Gifted as a musician, I played guitar on a grand level  
The most talented where I'm from, but I had to rebel  
And so I'm off in the sunset, searchin' for my place in the world  
With my guitar up on my hip, that's the story unfurled  
I found myself with a pocket full of money and a whole lot of respect  
While the record business loved me  
I was head of rhythm and blues  
The women that fell to they feet, so many to choose  
But I manipulated power as I lied to the masses  
Died with my money, gluttony was too attractive, reincarnated

\[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar\]  
Another life had placed me as a Black woman in the Chitlin' Circuit  
Seductive vocalist as the promoter hit the curtains  
My voice was angelic, straight from heaven, the crowd sobbed  
A musical genius what the articles emphasized  
Had everything I wanted, but I couldn't escape addiction  
Heroin needles had me in fetal position, restricted  
Turned on my family, I went wherever cameras be  
Cocaine, no private planes for my insanity  
Self-indulged, discipline never been my sentiments  
I needed drugs, to me, an 8-ball was like penicillin  
Fuck love, my happiness was in that brown sugar  
Sex and melodies gave me hope when nobody's lookin'  
My first assistant was a small town scholar  
Never did a Quaalude 'til I got myself around her  
My daddy looked the other way, he saw sin in me  
I died with syringes pinched in me, reincarnated

\[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar\]  
My present life is Kendrick Lamar  
A rapper looking at the lyrics to keep you in awe  
The only factor I respected was raisin' the bar  
My instincts sent material straight to the charts, huh  
My father kicked me out the house, I finally forgive him  
I'm old enough to understand the way I was livin'  
Ego and pride had me looking at him with resentment  
I close my eyes, hoping that I don't come off contentious  
I'm yelling, "Father, did I finally get it right?" Everything I did was selfless  
I spoke freely, when the people needed me, I helped them  
I didn't gloat, even told 'em, "No," when the vultures came  
Took control of my fleshly body when the money changed  
Son, you do well, but your heart is closed  
I can tell residue that linger from your past creates a cell  
Father, I'm not perfect, I got urges, but I hold them down  
"But your pride has to die," okay, Father, show me how  
Tell me every deed that you done and what you do it for  
I kept one hundred institutions paid  
Okay, tell me more  
I put one hundred hoods on one stage  
Okay, tell me more  
I'm tryna push peace in L.A.   
But you love war  
No, I don't  
Oh, yes, you do  
Okay, then tell me the truth  
Every individual is only a version of you  
How can they forgive when there's no forgiveness in your heart?  
I could tell you where I'm going  
I could tell you who you are  
You fell out of Heaven 'cause you was anxious  
Didn't like authority, only searched to be heinous  
Isaiah fourteen was the only thing that was prevalent  
My greatest music director was you  
It was colors, it was pinks, it was reds, it was blues  
It was harmony and motion  
I sent you down to earth 'cause you was broken  
Rehabilitation, not psychosis  
But now we here now  
Centuries you manipulated man with music  
Embodied you as superstars to see how you moving  
You came a long way from garnishing evilish views  
And all I ever wanted from you was love and approval  
I learned a lot, no more putting these people in fear  
The more that word is diminished, the more it's not real  
The more light that I can capture, the more I can feel  
I'm using words for inspiration as an idea  
So can you promise that you won't take your gifts for granted?  
I promise that I'll use my gifts to bring understanding  
For every man, woman and child, how much can you vow?  
I vow my life just to live one in harmony now  
You crushed a lot of people keeping their thoughts in captivity  
And I'm ashamed that I ever created that enemy  
Then let's rejoice where we at  
I rewrote the devil's story just to take our power back, 'carnated

\[Part I\]

\[Intro: Kendrick Lamar\]  
All I ever wanted was a black Grand National  
Fuck being rational, give 'em what they ask for

\[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar\]  
It's not enough (Ayy)  
Few solid niggas left, but it's not enough  
Few bitches that'll really step, but it's not enough  
Say you bigger than myself, but it's not enough (Huh)  
I get on they ass, yeah, somebody gotta do it  
I'll make them niggas mad, yeah, somebody gotta do it  
I'll take the G pass, shit, watch a nigga do it  
Huh, we survived outside, all from the music, nigga, what?

\[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar\]  
They like, "What he on?"  
It's the alpha and omega, bitch, welcome home  
This is not a song  
This a revelation, how to get a nigga gone  
You need you a man, baby, I don't understand, baby  
Pay your bill and make you feel protected like I can, baby  
Teach you somethin' if you need correction, that's the plan, baby  
Don't put your life in these weird niggas' hands, baby (Woah)

\[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar\]  
It's not enough (Ayy)  
Few solid niggas left, but it's not enough  
Few bitches that'll really step, but it's not enough  
Say you bigger than myself, but it's not enough (Huh)

Huh, we survived outside, all from the music, nigga, what?

\[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar\]  
Hey, turn his TV off  
Ain't with my type activities? Then don't you get involved  
Hey, what, huh, how many should I send? Send 'em all  
Take a risk or take a trip, you know I'm trippin' for my dog  
Who you with? Couple sergeants and lieutenants for the get back  
This revolution been televised, I fell through with the knick-knacks  
Hey, young nigga, get your chili up, yeah, I meant that  
Hey, black out if they act out, yeah, I did that  
Hey, what's up, though?  
I hate a bitch that's hatin' on a bitch and they both hoes  
I hate a nigga hatin' on them niggas and they both broke  
If you ain't coming for no chili, what you come for?  
Nigga feel like he entitled 'cause he knew me since a kid  
Bitch, I cut my granny off if she don't see it how I see it, hm  
Got a big mouth but he lack big ideas  
Send him to the moon, that's just how I feel, yellin'

\[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar\]  
It's not enough (Ayy)  
Few solid niggas left, but it's not enough  
Few bitches that'll really step, but it's not enough  
Say you bigger than myself, but it's not enough

\[Intro: Kendrick Lamar\]  
Huh  
Huh, huh  
Hey  
Hey (Mustard on the beat, ho)

\[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar\]  
Mustard  
Niggas actin' bad, but somebody gotta do it  
Got my foot up on the gas, but somebody gotta do it  
Huh, turn his TV off, turn his TV off  
Huh, turn his TV off, turn his TV off  
Huh, turn his TV off, turn his TV off  
Huh, turn his TV off, turn his TV off

\[Verse: Kendrick Lamar\]  
Ain't no other king in this rap thing, they siblings  
Nothing but my children, one shot, they disappearin'  
I'm in the city where the flag be gettin' thrown like it was pass interference  
Padlock around the building  
Crash, pullin' up in unmarked truck just to play freeze tag  
With a bone to pick like it was sea bass  
So when I made it out, I made about 50K from a show  
Tryna show niggas the ropes before they hung from a rope  
I'm prophetic, they only talk about it how I get it  
Only good for saving face, seen the cosmetics  
How many heads I gotta take to level my aesthetics?  
Hurry up and get your muscle up, we out the plyometric  
Nigga ran up out of luck soon as I upped the highest metric  
The city just made it sweet, you could die, I bet it  
They mouth get full of deceit, let these cowards tell it  
Walk in New Orleans with the etiquette of LA, yellin'

\[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar\]  
Mustard (Ah, man)  
Niggas actin' bad, but somebody gotta do it  
Got my foot up on the gas, but somebody gotta do it  
Huh, turn his TV off, turn his TV off  
Huh, turn his TV off, turn his TV off  
Huh, turn his TV off, turn his TV off  
Huh, turn his TV off, turn his TV off

\[Outro: Lefty Gunplay\]  
Shit gets crazy, scary, spooky, hilarious  
Crazy, scary, spooky, hilarious  
Shit gets crazy, scary, spooky, hilarious  
Crazy, scary, spooky, hilarious  
Shit gets crazy, scary, spooky, hilarious  
Crazy, scary, spooky, hilarious  
Shit gets crazy, scary, spooky, hilarious  
Crazy, scary, spooky, hilarious

White diamonds, 2 a.m., she wildin'  
Bitches sick, got their stomach in her comments  
What school you went to? Gardena, Compton  
Westchester, King/Drew, then we function  
Little nigga, but that dog in me, that's on Top  
On my kids, I'll sock you niggas up  
Have you ever took a fade and ran three more back to back?  
Oh, you haven't? Then shut the fuck up and keep it rap  
Gah, gah, gah  
Bitch, I'm from the LAnd  
Don't say you hate L.A. when you don't travel past the 10  
Am I trippin'? Yes, I am  
Meditate over some money, I see Franklin, I find zen  
Bitch, I'm from the LAnd  
Don't say you hate L.A., but live in L.A. and pretend  
My neck on Tarantino, Alejandro, Spike Lee  
Just know you took the scenic route if you stand by me, stupid

Ain't no sleepin' in on Sunday  
If it's 'bout the money, then my niggas on go

When I walk in, oh yeah, bring that  
It's unanimous, how I pop shit

Walk, walk, walk, walk  
Walk, walk, walk, walk  
Tip, toe, pivot, walk

\_\_"Heart Pt. 6"\_\_

\[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar\]  
Load up the Pro Tools and press three  
Studio filled with Jack In The Box and Pepsis  
Niggas watchin' WorldStar videos, not the ESPYs  
Laughin' at B. Pumper, stomach turnin', I get up and proceeded to write somethin'  
Ab-Soul in the corner mumblin' raps, fumblin' packs of Black & Milds  
Crumblin' kush 'til he cracked a smile  
His words legendary, wishin' I could rhyme like him  
Studied his style to define my pen  
That was back when the only goal was to get Jay Rock through the door  
Warner Brother Records, hope Naim Ali would let us know  
Was excited just to go to them label meetings  
Wasn't my record deal, but still, I couldn't believe it  
Me and Rock inside the booth hibernatin'  
It was simple math, if he made it, that mean I made it  
Everything I had was for the team, I remained patient  
Grindin' with my brothers, it was us against them, no one above us, bless our hearts

\[Chorus: SWV & Coko\]  
Use your heart and not your eyes (Baby, just relax your mind)  
If you got time, then I got time (Yeah, yeah)  
Free your thoughts and watch them fly  
Use your heart and not your eyes (Mm-hmm)

\[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar\]  
My nigga Dave had a champagne Acura  
A bunch of instrumentals I freestyled in the passenger  
That nigga wore several hats, a producer, a manager, director, and DJ  
A hothead squabblin', Bloods, Pirus, and Keeways  
For this little thing of ours we called TDE  
I watched you take some penitentiary chances to say the least  
Remember in the county building with MixedByAli  
We tried to freak the system just to make a couple ends meet  
That's my nigga for shit sure  
He brought Q over, but Q didn't rap, but he learned from our inspo  
We split Louisiana chicken riverboat specials  
Sleepin' next to 02R consoles to be our refuge  
He was homeless and I left home  
Q said, "Dot, you won't be slept on, you the nigga to bet on" (Use your h—)  
Top had given us dominion in the home he lived in  
Hopin' that we see some millions, God bless our hearts

\[Chorus: SWV & Coko\]  
Use your heart and not your eyes (Baby, just relax your mind)  
If you got time, then I got time (Yeah, yeah)  
Free your thoughts and watch them fly  
Use your heart and not your eyes

\[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar\]  
Punch played Phil Jackson in my early practices  
Strategies on how to be great amongst the averages  
I picked his brain on what was ordained, highly collaborative  
RET pushed the label the same, amongst the savages  
Moose kept my name in the function that he would run in  
TEEZ kept the vultures away from me that was comin'  
Sounwave let me borrow his clothes for shows as a hype man  
To cook up in this room 'til the night ends  
Time flies, I'm carryin' debates of a top five  
Buryin' my opps and allies  
But I'd done a half job communicatin' feelings of being stagnant  
Life was gettin' bigger than just rappin'  
The business, what I was lackin'  
Top used to record me back when it was poor me  
And now we at the round table for what assures me  
I guess my motivation was the yearnin' for independence  
Poured everything I had left in the family business  
Now it's about Kendrick, I wanna evolve, place my skillset as a Black exec'  
I jog my memory, knowin' Black Hippy didn't work 'cause of me  
Creatively, I moved on with new concepts in reach  
Top, remember all them sessions we would strategize  
To hit the streets, then come back, record three records? Ah  
To tell the truth, it fucked me up when D-Man passed  
The motive was the condolences, but the pride crashed  
I had to bypass old mythologies I had  
Put my heart on display like it was an iMac  
To all my young niggas, let me be the demonstration  
How to conduct differences with a healthy conversation  
If that's your family, then handle it as such  
Don't let the socials gas you up or let emotions be your crutch  
Pick up the phone and bust it up before the history is lost  
Hand-to-handshake is good when you have a heart-to-heart

\[Chorus: SWV & Coko\]  
Use your heart and not your eyes (Baby, just relax your mind)  
If you got time and I got time (Yeah, yeah)  
Free your thoughts and watch them fly  
Use your heart and not your eyes (Mm-hmm)

Tell 'em Kendrick did it, ayy, who showed you how to run a blitz?  
Tell 'em Kendrick did it, who put the West back in front of shit?  
Tell 'em Kendrick did it, ayy, I'm trippin' and I'm lovin' it  
Tell 'em Kendrick did it, like, wha—  
Hi, have you ever been a joint and you know it?  
Have you ever had to flip your unemployment?  
On the dead guys, nigga, I ain't goin'

\[Verse 1: Peysoh\]  
Ayy, on the dead ones  
We'll treat an enemigo like some bread crumbs  
All of my killers on go, like, who said somethin'?  
Redrum, all I think about when I see heads come  
Do my dance, hit the chop when I see opps go  
Let 'em claim it, we the ones who really pop, bro  
Don't televise it, we the ones who lettin' chops blow  
Opps know, let 'em piss him off and it's a flop show  
Murder man, singin' murder music off a murder van  
Beat the pussy up like I been celibate and I murder sound  
Who is him? One and only shotta, known as murder man  
Catch you doin' dirty, it's no other way but murder plans  
I broke her heart and you the type to go and fix it  
Don't wanna speak if you ain't talkin' 'bout no ticket  
I'm bougie with it, but I might just let you kiss it  
Hit that block with diamonds on me, you could tell 'em Peysoh did it

Tell 'em Peysoh did it, ayy, who showed you how to run a blitz?  
Tell 'em Peysoh did it, who put the West back in front of shit?  
Tell 'em Peysoh did it, ayy, I'm trippin' and I'm lovin' it  
Tell 'em Peysoh did it, like, wha—  
Hi, have you ever been a joint and you know it?  
Have you ever had to flip your unemployment?  
On the dead guys, nigga, I ain't goin'

\[Verse 2: Hitta J3 & Kendrick Lamar\]  
Hop out suicide doors, it's the Hitta, man  
You don't wanna see them doors slidin' on the Caravan  
I know killers who was catchin' bodies and not one fade  
I was thirteen up at Avalon, poppin' chains  
Fourteen, ridin' minibikes with some dead friends  
Twenty-one, flag on my head like a Taliban  
Twenty-five, feelin' like the box, it was full of sand  
At the cemetery, fuck that, that's where I could've been  
142nd, I'm connected like I'm Rosecrans  
Kinda shit I seen, try and forget and I will pop a Xan'  
Uppin' scores, doin' files, sacrifices like a boxing ring  
Can't throw in the towel, pistol-packin' since a child  
Ayy, like it's Iraq, shooter name Hussein  
Ridin' with the dirty blicky, switchy, make a new flame  
She said I been a dog all my life, bae, can you change?  
True to my religion, Cuban links, more than two chains

\[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar & Hitta J3\]  
Tell 'em Hitta did it, ayy, who showed you how to run a blitz?  
Tell 'em Hitta did it, who put the West back in front of shit?

\[Verse 3: YoungThreat\]  
It's gettin' down to the wire  
Get on my Bob the Builder shit, get down with the pliers  
Been comin' back-to-back hits, how this nigga ain't tired?  
I'm with some rockstar bitches, they want Lizzie McGuire  
I'm switchin' gears, I pop the clutch, I'll send a nigga up  
A risk-taker, I'll call you niggas' bluff  
If they hangin' out for real, we come deduct, tuckin' tails, they out of luck  
When it's wartime, they hidin' in the cut  
Y'all had y'all chance, y'all couldn't do it  
I swear I'm comin' worse than y'all baby moms, I'm puttin' niggas through it  
They hate to see me doin' it  
Meal ticket, I'm pursuin' it  
I'm in the field for real, UCLA Bruins  
They askin' how I do it, how a young nigga so fluent  
I kept my mouth closed and I ain't never leave no witness  
D.O.A. up on the scene, tell 'em YoungThreat did it, nigga

Sentado, Anita y tú

\[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar\]  
Me and my bitch got a complicated relationship  
She's so controllin', I noticed it ain't no playin' with  
I met her when I was off the porch as a teenager  
She said one day I would right my wrongs and see paper  
We started out young, lookin' for some identity, made a thousand mistakes  
But never did we lack chemistry  
Wrappin' my hand 'round your waist  
That was back when you did whatever I say  
Dreams of sellin' narcotics, runnin' blocks, or robbin' banks  
I was in love with you, didn't know what it was with you  
Kiss you in back of the class just to get a buzz with you  
Some niggas wanted you, but they weren't committed  
Preoccupied playin' John Madden and bullshittin'  
Remember when granny died? You looked at me and said, "Baby, dry your eyes  
Depend on me as your relief, let your anger be mine"  
We was locked in ever since then  
So territorial, even took me 'way from my friends, hmm, hmm (Gah, gah, gah)

\[Chorus: SZA\]  
Scared of forever, you know nothin' else is gon' pass  
I just gotta let you know, woah  
Whenever you want me, you got me 'til the end of time  
Ooh, just gotta let you know

\[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar\]  
Said you gon' see other people if I didn't grow with you  
Wasn't no more holdin' them pistols in front of stores with you  
You want reality, not tragedy, for sure, I get you  
To tell the truth, I been pretty used to what open-minded people do  
In 2014, I went to Africa, baby, you was my passenger  
My eyes and ears for all the years the neighborhood had baffled us  
Of course I had to wrap it up, I didn't fully trust you  
Fabrication, I disgust you, then you blocked me, I said, "Fuck you"

\[Interlude: SZA & Kendrick Lamar\]  
Nigga, what?  
I gave you life, I breathe the motherfuckin' charisma in this bitch  
I bring the blessings, I gave you power  
Nigga, I bring the rainfall, I gave you hustle  
Then fall right back in love the very moment that I touch you (Gah, gah, gah)

\[Chorus: SZA\]  
Scared of forever, you know nothin' else is gon' pass  
I just gotta let you know  
Whenever you want me, you got me 'til the end of time  
Ooh, just gotta let you know

\[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar\]  
You were spontaneous, firecracker, plus our love is dangerous  
Life of passion, laughin' at you lose your temper, slightly crashin'  
Dumb enough to ill reaction, ain't no disrespect  
Highly sensitive, possessed, saw potential, even when it's tragic  
So jealous, hate it when I hit the club to get some bitches  
Wrote 'em off, rather see me hit the church and get religious  
Who you foolin'? I know what you doin', you my contradiction  
'Member when you caught that body and still wiggled through that sentence?  
Loved you more, when you flip and lose your shit, I hugged you more  
It's sexy to me, cuss they ass out and hold that grudge some more  
Down bitch, I know your favorite movie, is it Notebook?  
So good, if they all sub me, get 'em all booked  
My baby boo, you either heal niggas or you kill niggas  
Both is true, it take some tough skin just to deal with you  
Logical explanation don't exist, flippin' pages  
Chapter after chapter, probably remarry and head to Vegas  
Bitches gettin' marked out, they can't erase our history  
They margins ain't big enough, they all led by bigotry  
My woman and my right hand, my saint and my sin  
Ain't no bitch like my bitch 'cause that bitch been my pen

\[Outro: SZA\]  
Gloria, I wanna take you to euphoria  
Bitches want, but they ain't strong enough  
I heard they talking, we notorious  
If someone talking on me  
I see you, you see me  
Both see what we want, oh, oh  
I see you, you see me  
Both see what we want

# **Analysis** 

# **GNX as Medium: Analysis of "Wacced Out Murals"**

## **Opening Track as Vehicle Framework**

The opening track establishes the GNX (Grand National Experimental) as more than just a car \- it's a framework for exploring themes of power, authenticity, and cultural preservation. The Spanish opening by Deyra Barrera ("Siento aquí tu presencia / La noche de anoche / Y nos ponemos a llorar" \- "I feel your presence here / Last night / And we start to cry") immediately establishes themes of presence and absence that will resonate throughout the album.

### **1\. Physical Movement & Power**

\- The GNX serves as both defensive and offensive capability  
\- Movement through physical space (streets) parallels movement through cultural space  
\- Direct reference in lyrics: "Ridin' in my GNX with Anita Baker in the tape deck, it's gon' be a sweet love"  
\- Power as both protection and potential for confrontation

### **2\. Cultural Preservation & Resistance**

\- The vandalized mural incident becomes metaphor for broader cultural erasure attempts  
\- Key lyric: "Yesterday, somebody whacked out my mural / That energy'll make you niggas move to Europe / But it's regular for me, yeah, that's for sure"  
\- Spelling of "Wacced" deliberately avoids "CK" (Crip Killer) connotation, showing deep understanding of cultural codes  
\- Response to real-world vandalism of Gustavo Zermeño Jr's mural at Compton's Honduras Restaurant Mi Sabor's

### **3\. Legacy & Inheritance**

\- Reference to uncle and Wayne establishes generational connections: "Miss my uncle Lil' Mane, he said that he would kill me if I didn't make it"  
\- Wayne connection: "Used to bump Tha Carter III, I held my Rollie chain proud / Irony, I think my hard work let Lil Wayne down"  
\- GNX represents earned success and authentic power

### **4\. Rules of Engagement**

The chorus explicitly lays out rules for cultural navigation:  
"Yeah, nigga, go and up your rank  
Know you a god even when they say you ain't  
Yeah, nigga, keep your feelings out the way  
Never let no one put smut up on your name"

### **5\. Cultural Synthesis**

\- Spanish elements reflect LA's cultural fabric  
\- Car culture meets hip-hop authenticity  
\- GNX as symbol of both technical excellence and cultural power  
\- Reference to cultural icons: "Snoop posted 'Taylor Made,' I prayed it was the edibles"

## **The Mural Incident as Catalyst**

The real-world vandalism by Compton Varrio Tortilla Flats 13 (CVTF) becomes central metaphor:  
\- Physical defacement (crossed-out eyes, PK tags) representing broader cultural threats  
\- Community response captured in Gustavo's Instagram post  
\- Transformation of destruction into artistic creation  
\- Later referenced again in "Man at the Garden": "One hundred murals out in Compton"

## **Vehicle as Metaphor**

The GNX framework operates on multiple levels:  
\- Movement through hostile territory: "All this talk is bitch-made, that's on my Lord"  
\- Protection of cultural legacy: "I done been through it all, what you endure?"  
\- Display of earned power: "I paid homage and I always mind my business"  
\- Technical mastery as artistic expression

The track's structure mirrors the GNX's mechanical precision while maintaining raw power, establishing the vehicle not just as a status symbol but as a complex framework for navigating cultural spaces while preserving authenticity. The fact that only 547 GNXs were ever produced adds to its symbolism of exclusivity and earned status.

The opening track thus sets up the album's central metaphor: the GNX as a vehicle for both physical and cultural mobility, protection, and power. This framework will be developed throughout the album, with each track exploring different aspects of this metaphorical vehicle.

# **"Squabble Up" Analysis: GNX as Vehicle for Cultural Reclamation**

## **Overview**

Within Kendrick Lamar's conceptual album GNX, "Squabble Up" emerges as a pivotal track that reinforces the album's central metaphor of the Buick Grand National Experimental (GNX) as a vehicle for cultural expression and protection. The song demonstrates how the GNX framework operates on multiple levels, from physical mobility to intellectual property defense.

## **Core Metaphorical Elements**

### **The Vehicle as Defender**

The track opens with immediate references to protection and ownership: "High-key, keep a horn on me, that Kamasi / IP, ownership, the blueprint is by me." This positioning establishes the GNX not just as a car, but as a means of defending artistic territory. The reference to "broccoli" appears to address issues of stolen intellectual property, with the vehicle serving as both protection and means of reclamation.

### **Technical Excellence**

Just as the GNX was known for its engineering precision, the track demonstrates technical mastery through:  
\- Complex rhythmic patterns  
\- Multiple flow switches  
\- Strategic use of silence and space  
\- Reference to jazz virtuoso Kamasi Washington

### **Mobility & Power**

The song's aggressive energy mirrors the GNX's reputation for power, while exploring:  
\- Territorial movement ("A yee nigga couldn't try me in the tri-state")  
\- Strategic positioning ("Hit his turf and get crackin', double back like a delux")  
\- Group mobility ("Fifty deep, but it ain't deep enough")

## **Thematic Layers**

### **Cultural Authority**

The track asserts dominance across multiple dimensions:  
\- Geographical space (references to tri-state area and international reach)

# **"Hey Now" \- Movement Through Spaces**

## **A Complex Study of Power, Mobility, and Status**

"Hey Now" emerges as one of the album's most layered explorations of movement and power, weaving together themes of spiritual seeking, financial ascension, and cultural navigation. While the track connects to the album's broader vehicle motifs, it expands well beyond them into a meditation on different forms of mobility and mastery.

### **Spiritual and Material Duality**

The opening lines immediately establish this duality:

* "I'm all about my Yen" suggests both financial currency and Buddhist spiritual concepts  
* "Big face Buddha, get my peace from within" directly connects material wealth (big face bills) with spiritual enlightenment  
* This creates a framework where external success and internal peace aren't opposing forces but complementary paths

### **Movement Through Different Realms**

## **Physical Space**

The track charts movement through various territories:

* Street level navigation ("slid on they backstreet")  
* Aerial ascension ("Gulf streams, back to back")

# **Reconnaissance Through Time: Analysis of "Reincarnated"**

## **Overview: Beyond the Vehicle**

While "Reincarnated" exists within the album's broader GNX framework, its true power comes from transforming the concept of movement and reconnaissance into something far more spiritual and expansive. Like a scout moving through enemy territory, the song's narrator traverses different eras and identities, gathering intelligence about the nature of power, artistry, and redemption. "Reincarnated" represents a pivotal expansion of the album's GNX framework, transforming the vehicle metaphor from physical movement through space to spiritual movement through time. The track's three-verse structure maps perfectly onto the concept of the Grand National Experimental, with each "incarnation" representing a different configuration of artistic power and technical mastery.

## **Structural Analysis**

### **Spanish Introduction**

The Spanish opening by Deyra Barrera continues the album's pattern of using Spanish to frame key transitions, here setting up the theme of reflection and temporal movement. The reference to "mirada" (gaze/look) establishes the retrospective nature of the narrative.

### **Three Lives as Reconnaissance Missions**

The song's three-verse structure functions like a series of deep reconnaissance missions into different territories of American musical experience. Each life serves as an infiltration into a different era, gathering intelligence about how power, art, and addiction intersect:

1. The 1947 Michigan guitarist \- exploring the territory of early rock and rhythm & blues  
2. The female blues singer in the Chitlin' Circuit \- surveying the landscape of segregation and artistic resilience  
3. Present-day Kendrick Lamar \- synthesizing these gathered insights into contemporary understanding

Each incarnation serves as both observer and participant, collecting vital intelligence about the nature of artistic power and its costs.

## **Thematic Elements**

### **Technical Evolution**

Like the GNX's mechanical refinement, each incarnation shows mastery of different musical forms:

1. Guitar virtuosity ("played guitar on a grand level")

Like a scout who goes so deep undercover they begin to question their original identity, each incarnation reveals both the allure and danger of complete immersion in different forms of artistic power.

The song's genius lies in its suggestion that true understanding requires more than observation \- it demands participation, even at the cost of corruption. Each life serves as a form of spiritual combat intelligence, gathering vital information about how power operates across different contexts, how it corrupts, and ultimately, how it might be redeemed.

In its final verse, when the dialogue shifts to a cosmic scale, we see the ultimate purpose of this reconnaissance mission through time \- not just to understand power, but to transform it, to "rewrite the devil's story just to take our power back." This makes the song not just a meditation on artistic responsibility, but a blueprint for spiritual warfare, fought across generations, with the ultimate goal of redemption.

# **"TV Off" \- Power and Control Through the GNX Framework**

## **Introduction**

"TV Off" emerges as a pivotal track in GNX, representing one of the album's most direct engagements with its central metaphor while simultaneously expanding it into new conceptual territories. Opening with the stark declaration "All I ever wanted was a black Grand National / Fuck being rational, give 'em what they ask for," the song immediately establishes a complex relationship between desire, power, and rationality that unfolds across its carefully structured two-part composition.

## **The Vehicle as Framework**

### **Raw Desire vs. Technical Control**

The opening lines position the GNX not just as a status symbol but as an object of explicitly irrational desire. This immediately complicates the album's vehicle metaphor \- the GNX represents both calculated technical excellence and raw, emotional power. This duality mirrors the vehicle's own nature as both a luxury car and a performance machine.

Where previous tracks might have emphasized the GNX's technical precision or cultural significance, "TV Off" foregrounds the visceral, emotional connection to the vehicle. The rejection of rationality ("Fuck being rational") suggests that true power sometimes requires embracing the irrational, much like the GNX's arguably irrational combination of luxury sedan and drag racing performance.

### **Warfare and Strategic Movement**

* "unmarked truck" mirrors military reconnaissance vehicles  
* References to coordinated group actions ("Send 'em all")  
2. International Conflict Parallels Just as the GNX was known for its stealth capabilities, the track explores themes of anonymity and hidden power:  
* The reference to Saddam Hussein's capture resonates with themes of powerful figures trying to maintain anonymity  
* Military terminology repurposed for street context suggests parallel power structures  
* Strategic use of unmarked vehicles and coordinated movements mirrors warfare tactics  
3. Movement Through Spaces The track demonstrates sophisticated navigation across multiple dimensions:  
* Direct vehicle references ("foot up on the gas")  
* Geographic movement ("Walk in New Orleans with the etiquette of LA")  
* Strategic positioning ("Crash, pullin' up in unmarked truck")  
2. Social Space  
* Hierarchical movement ("sergeants and lieutenants")  
* Cultural authority ("Ain't no other king in this rap thing")  
* Strategic visibility/invisibility ("turn his TV off")  
3. Power Space  
* Technical mastery ("level my aesthetics")  
* Raw force ("how many should I send? Send 'em all")  
* Cultural influence ("This revolution been televised")

1. Organization  
   * Military hierarchy ("sergeants and lieutenants")  
   * Coordinated operations ("how many should I send?")  
   * Strategic deployment of force  
2. Stealth Operations  
   * Use of unmarked vehicles  
   * Strategic visibility/invisibility  
   * Coordinated group movements  
3. Power Structures  
   * Parallel hierarchies between military and street organizations  
   * Similar tactics adapted to different contexts  
   * Use of anonymity as both protection and threat

## **Power Dynamics**

### **Technical Excellence**

The track's exploration of technical mastery manifests through:

* Metrics and measurement references

# **"Gloria" \- Love Letter to the Art Form: A Deep Analysis**

## **Introduction**

"Gloria" stands as one of the album's most intimate and revealing tracks, using the framework of a complex romantic relationship to explore Kendrick's connection with his art form. While the album broadly explores themes of movement and power through its vehicle motif, this song takes a more personal approach, examining how art itself becomes both companion and conveyance on the journey toward authentic expression.

## **The Love Story as Central Metaphor**

### **Early Days**

The track opens with raw honesty about artistic beginnings: "Me and my bitch got a complicated relationship / She's so controllin', I noticed it ain't no playin' with." This immediately establishes the central tension \- art demands complete dedication while promising no guarantees. The teenage origin story ("I met her when I was off the porch as a teenager") mirrors many artists' first encounters with their craft, that moment when casual interest transforms into serious pursuit.

### **Growth Together**

The song charts mutual development through several key phases:

* Initial attraction ("Kiss you in back of the class just to get a buzz with you")  
* Early struggles ("Dreams of sellin' narcotics, runnin' blocks, or robbin' banks")  
* Deepening commitment ("We was locked in ever since then")  
* Growing pains ("Said you gon' see other people if I didn't grow with you")

This progression reveals how artistic development parallels personal growth, each informing and challenging the other.

## **Art as Both Savior and Demon**

One of the song's most compelling aspects is its portrayal of art's dual nature:

### **Healing Force**

* Emotional support ("Baby, dry your eyes / Depend on me as your relief")  
* Life direction ("right my wrongs and see paper")  
* Spiritual connection ("hit the church and get religious")

### **Destructive Power**

* Jealous demands ("So territorial, even took me 'way from my friends")  
* Volatile nature ("firecracker, plus our love is dangerous")  
* Moral ambiguity ("you either heal niggas or you kill niggas")

## **The Journey Together**

The Africa reference ("In 2014, I went to Africa, baby, you was my passenger") takes on special significance, suggesting how art becomes both companion and vehicle for exploration \- not just of physical spaces but of cultural and spiritual territories. This connects naturally to the album's broader themes of movement and discovery without forcing the vehicle metaphor.

## **Technical Mastery as Relationship Development**

The song presents artistic growth as relationship milestones:

* Learning to handle mood swings ("laughin' at you lose your temper")  
* Developing trust ("Of course I had to wrap it up, I didn't fully trust you")  
* Finding balance ("My woman and my right hand, my saint and my sin")

## **The Power Dynamic**

Perhaps most intriguingly, the track explores the shifting power balance between artist and art:

### **Art's Power Over Artist**

* Guidance ("I gave you life")  
* Inspiration ("I breathe the motherfuckin' charisma in this bitch")  
* Transformation ("I bring the rainfall, I gave you hustle")

### **Artist's Growth Into Mastery**

* Technical control ("you did whatever I say")  
* Creative direction ("saw potential, even when it's tragic")  
* Ultimate partnership ("Both see what we want")

## **The Revelation**

The song's final revelation ("Ain't no bitch like my bitch 'cause that bitch been my pen") transforms everything that came before. This isn't just about art in the abstract \- it's specifically about writing, about the intimate relationship between writer and word. The pen becomes both tool and companion, the means of both creation and liberation.

## **SZA's Chorus as Greek Chorus**

SZA's contributions provide crucial context and counterpoint:

* Fear of commitment ("Scared of forever")  
* Promise of dedication ("got me 'til the end of time")  
* Celebration of notoriety ("we notorious")

Her outro's reference to "euphoria" suggests art's ultimate promise \- transcendence through creation.

## **Conclusion**

"Gloria" emerges as one of the album's most personal statements, using the metaphor of romantic relationship to explore the complex dynamic between artist and art. While it connects naturally to the album's broader themes of movement and power, its strength lies in its intimate portrayal of artistic development as love story.

The track suggests that true mastery requires more than technical skill \- it demands a full emotional engagement with one's art, a willingness to weather its storms and celebrate its triumphs. Through this lens, creation becomes not just an act of skill but an act of love, with all the complexity, pain, and joy that implies.

The song's genius lies in how it makes universal what could have been purely personal. Every artist, regardless of medium, can recognize aspects of their own creative journey in this portrait of artistic relationship \- the early passion, the difficult growth, the moments of doubt, and ultimately, the deep bond that transcends simple categorization.

- Kendrick LPs have followed a pattern of choosing a medium to explore   
  - Section 8 : Story Telling around a fire  
  - Good Kid Maad City: short film   
  - TPAB: Poem   
  - DAMN: Magazine   
  - Mr.morale: a play   
  - GNX: his career as a vehicle for war and validation  
- This album is dedicated to his one true love, gloria, the game, GNX, his vehicle for both defending his culture and ascending with it the GNX as a vehicle for both physical and cultural mobility, protection, and power. 

Section.80 was a fireside story. GKMC a short film. TPAB a poem built line by line. DAMN. a reversible magazine. Mr. Morale a theatrical play.  GNX is his career/vehicle of social and cultural mobility as both war machine and cultural shield.

The GNX becomes a performance space, battle station, and escape route  the same way  hip-hop functions as entertainment, cultural weapon, and path to cultural transcendence.

### **Wacced out Murals**

- The name is pretty self descriptive , about the destructions of icons in the public sphere/black community   
- Also has to do with kendricks actual mural being defaced  
- \- Spelling of "Wacced" deliberately avoids "CK" (Crip Killer) connotation  
- Can only rely on your own power and mobility to protect your culture  
- References lil wayne and snoop acting less than gracefully   
- 

### **Squabble Up** 

- References to war, size, and mobility   
- A call to arms  
- Ownership of the car → ownership of the culture   
- He’s actually authentic and he’s looking for broccoli not just stealing DRAMs songs and making them Hotline Bling  
- Sample is the ghost of aliyah telling him that he now controls the rap game and it’s his chance to defend it now 

### **Luther** 

- Luther Vandeross Sample   
- Martin Luther King as someone that espoused non-violence  
- The track's sampling of "If This World Were Mine" demonstrates how the GNX framework facilitates movement between:  
* Different eras (1967 Marvin Gaye original → 1982 Luther cover → 2024 recontextualization)  
* Different genres (Soul → R\&B → Contemporary Hip-Hop)  
* Different emotional registers (aggression → tenderness)

Luther Vandross Connection

Technical Excellence

Luther Vandross was known for his precise vocal control and technical mastery

This mirrors the GNX's reputation for mechanical precision

The sampling of Vandross's version of "If This World Were Mine" emphasizes this connection

Cultural Navigation

Vandross successfully moved between R\&B, soul, and pop genres

Like the GNX, he represented both power and refinement

His ability to transform songs through covers parallels the album's transformation of the vehicle metaphor

Historical Legacy

Vandross preserved and renewed soul classics for new generations

This preservation role aligns with the album's themes of cultural protection

The choice to reference his cover rather than Marvin Gaye's original emphasizes themes of transformation and renewal

Religious Undertones

Martin Luther References

The name evokes Martin Luther's role as a reformer

This connects to themes of challenging authority and institutional power

Reflects the album's broader concerns with authenticity and resistance

Spiritual Protection

Religious imagery throughout the track: "take your enemies in front of God"

Luther as spiritual guardian figure

Combines physical and spiritual protection themes

Integration with Album Narrative

"Luther" demonstrates the full versatility of the GNX as metaphorical framework by:

Expanding the vehicle metaphor beyond confrontation

Showing how technical precision can serve emotional expression

Maintaining the core themes of power and control while exploring tenderness

Using the vehicle's movement capabilities to traverse emotional territories

"Luther" represents a masterful expansion of the album's central metaphor, proving that the GNX framework can navigate both aggressive and tender emotional territories while maintaining its core themes of technical excellence, controlled power, and precise movement. The track's success in transforming a muscle car metaphor into a vehicle for exploring intimate relationships demonstrates the richness and flexibility of the album's conceptual framework.

The song serves as a crucial pivot point in the album's narrative, showing how the same vehicle that can serve as a weapon of cultural defense can also function as a space for vulnerability and connection. This duality enriches the overall metaphor and deepens our understanding of both the GNX as medium and the album's larger artistic ambitions.

\-----

### **Man at the Garden**

- "Man at the Garden" emerges as a meditation on deserved success, personal growth, and generational impact. While the GNX appears as one symbol of achievement ("GNX with the seat back, reclinin'"), the song's scope extends far beyond, exploring themes of spiritual fulfillment, family legacy, and cultural impact.  
- The track ultimately suggests that true deserving comes not just from what one achieves, but from how one achieves it and what one does with that success. It's a meditation on legacy that operates simultaneously on personal, familial, cultural, and spiritual levels.  
    
- He splits into 3 types of success  
- Material Success  
- "VVSs, white diamonds"  
- "Put my homes on the beachfront"  
- "Flyin' private"  
- Personal Development  
- "Twice emotional stability"  
- "Six miles a day, conditionin' my wind"  
- "my intentions was pure"  
- Cultural Impact  
- "One hundred murals out in Compton"  
- "Keep my name by the world leaders"  
- "Writin' words, tryna elevate these children"  
- A shot at jcole who famously “let nas down” someone that had a very similar song to this one   
- Essentially a self affirmation   
- How dare they speak "On the origins of the game I breathe?"  
- 

\----------

### **Hey Now**

- Movement through various types of spaces   
- 

Elaborate on this by considering the following notes:   
Over-Literal Vehicle Metaphor: While the GNX is a powerful symbol, reducing it to only a physical car limits its poetic potential. It should also represent time travel, spiritual recursion, and cultural DNA.  
Underdeveloped Theology: Tracks like "Luther" and "Reincarnated" hint at gnosticism and karmic cycles that need unpacking (e.g., Kendrick as a soul reincarnated to atone for music’s exploitation of Black pain).  
Hyperfocus on Combat: The "war" motif risks overshadowing the album’s vulnerability—Kendrick isn’t just defending culture but excavating his complicity in its commodification.  
J. Cole Reference: Your reading of "Man at the Garden" as a "shot" oversimplifies. It’s more about Kendrick’s existential panic at becoming the "old head" he once rebelled against.  
1\. "Wacced Out Murals"  
Mural as Collective Memory: The defaced mural isn’t just Kendrick’s—it’s a metaphor for how Black memorials are policed. The GNX becomes a mobile archive, carrying Compton’s stories to evade erasure.  
Nuance: The Spanish intro invokes Afro-Latinx spiritualism, framing the album as a séance with the past.  
6\. "Reincarnated"  
Father as God/Record Exec: Their dialogue mirrors a demo pitch, with God as a jaded A\&R questioning Kendrick’s "marketability." Salvation \= going platinum.  
\_\_\_\_  
12\. "Gloria" (feat. SZA)  
Deeper Layer: Gloria is Hip-Hop’s mother goddess (à la Yemoja), demanding blood sacrifice for success. Kendrick’s “pen” is a voodoo dagger, carving truth into industry lies.
